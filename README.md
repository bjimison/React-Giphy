This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This app allows users to search for Gif's provided by a third party api called [Giphy](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/).

I used React.js, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Axios to build this project.
